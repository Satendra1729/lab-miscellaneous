       ###############   Movie selection algorithm ################

I like to watch movies a lot. I use to follow rating based criteria to do may 
selection. I also like to watch only new style movies. According to myself new 
style movies are those movies where the advance graphics, visual effects and 
lovely music is available. 

First I check the the rating of movie on IMDB. There should be more then 30k 
reviewers and rating should be more then 6.5. Then I watch trailer, I belive a 
good movie should have a good trailer but vice versa is not true. Maker can 
create nice trailer for a waste movie like Matrix-4.
